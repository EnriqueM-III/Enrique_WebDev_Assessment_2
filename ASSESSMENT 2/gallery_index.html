                These are some of my works I have created. I have commissioned more than 50 artworks and these few I selected are I chose to be displayed
                on my portfolio. <br /><br />

                A little background as to what these are; I made these as a part of a <span>Text-based Roleplaying Community</span> where people partake in writing activities while
                roleplaying as characters in a fictional setting. In this case, a fantasy world where mages carry these magical books that grant them abilities.
                These books are called <span>Grimoires</span>.

                <br /><br />
                The community is named <span>Rise of the Zodiacs</span>. The lore is loosely based on the famous manga and anime series, <span>Black Clover</span>. Having their own
                original story and worldbuilding.
                The grimoires created by members of the community contain a symbol. The symbol varies on the kingdom the
                character resides in (Clover, Diamond, Heart, Spade) The clover variant however, their rarity and power varies on the number of clovers on the symbol.
                <br /><br />
                (3 = Regular, 4 = Luck, 5 = Cursed)

                <br /><br />

                Aside from being a member of this community and writing alongside them. I was happy to be involved with the community to add something special to their characters.
                <span>I created covers of their grimoires</span>.
                <br /> <br />
                I am simply given a material as to what their character's abilities are, specific symbols, color scheme. etc. to work with and show them the results. Making use of
                editing programs along with saved images to work on, I was able to create book covers that compliment their descriptions.
                <br /><br />
                Here are a few examples: (Hover the image to reveal titles)

                  <p>
                      I took the leisure in producing these works for the sole purpose of <span>practicing my skills</span> in <span>compositioning</span>, <span>blending colors and effects</span>, <span>color correction</span>, <span>layers</span>, everything related to image editing to create an
                      appropriate book cover that defines the description that was given to me. Every one that commissioned a piece were more than satisfied with the results and it is an overall amazing experience for me as an aspiring creator.
